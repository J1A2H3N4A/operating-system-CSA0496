Create a file or identify an existing file to demonstrate permissions and users.

View the file's permissions using the ls -l command. The output will look something like this:
.txt
The first character (-) represents the file type (a dash indicates a regular file).
The next three characters (rw-) represent the permissions for the file's owner (Read and Write, no Execute).
The next three characters (r--) represent the permissions for the file's group (Read, no Write or Execute).
The last three characters (r--) represent the permissions for others (Read, no Write or Execute).
The number 1 represents the number of hard links to the file.
owner is the username of the file's owner.
group is the name of the file's group.
1234 is the file's size in bytes.
Oct 19 10:30 is the last modification timestamp.
file.txt is the file name.
Use the chmod command to change the file's permissions. For example, to give the group write permission, use chmod g+w file.txt.
Re-run ls -l to confirm the updated permissions.
You can also change the file's owner and group using the chown and chgrp commands, respectively.
To create and manage user accounts, you can use the useradd and passwd commands.
PROGRAM:

#include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <sys/stat.h>

int main() {
char filename[] = "file.txt";
int new_permissions = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH; // rw-rw-r--

if (chmod(filename, new_permissions) == 0) { printf("File permissions changed successfully.\n");
} else {
perror("chmod"); return 1;

}

return 0;
}
